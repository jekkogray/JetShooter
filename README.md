## About
You are Jet Shooter, A badass jumbo jet from the future, where planes rules and rockets are the enemies with angry faces. A difficult and familiar air awaits you as you fight your way to this game.

Watch out for the rockets I swear, they can kill. If enough of them is given.

All Visuals are drawn by me btw, using Adobe Photshop and Illustrator.
